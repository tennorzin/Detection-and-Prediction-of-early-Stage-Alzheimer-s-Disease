# Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using CNNs

**Overview**
This repository showcases initial exploratory work on Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data. The project focuses on experimenting with four different filters applied to brain MRI images to explore their potential in enhancing feature extraction relevant to AD detection.

**Objective**
The main objective of this project is to investigate the impact of different filter sizes on MRI images for potential use in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease. By applying and comparing four distinct filters, the project aims to understand how these variations influence the representation of structural changes associated with AD.

**Methodology**
Dataset: Utilizing publicly available MRI datasets, the project begins with preprocessing steps such as normalization to ensure data consistency.

Filter Application: Implementing and applying four different filters (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.) to brain MRI images. Each filter size is chosen to capture specific structural details potentially indicative of AD progression.

Next Steps
The current stage of the project involves:

Data Exploration: Analyzing the visual impact and initial insights gained from applying different filters.
Future Work: Planning to expand the project by incorporating more advanced CNN architectures, training models, and evaluating performance metrics.
**Contribution**
Feedback and contributions to this initial exploration are welcome. Feel free to fork this repository, suggest improvements, or discuss potential collaborations to advance the project further.
